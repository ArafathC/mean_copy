#Extra Credit
If you're at this point, you've probably finished building our little ToDo web app in 1/4 or 1/2 the time we allotted. You're a [bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsUXAEzaC3Q) a$$!

Your ToDo app is pretty simple [SPA](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=single%20page%20application) right now: it queries a database, lists the result of that query to a web page, allows you to add and delete items from the database, and that's about it. You've basically built an app that does CRD (Create, Read, Delete). 

##Requirement 1: Allow updates to existing items in the database
We'd like to see full [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) in your app. 

You'll need at a minimum to make changes to...
- Routes in `server.js`
- Add logic to handle updates in 'mainController`
- Make changes to the front-end in `index.html`.

When you're done writing and testing your code, feel free to make a [pull request](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how%20to%20make%20a%20pull%20request) to this repo.
